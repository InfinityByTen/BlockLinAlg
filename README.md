# BlockLinAlg
Scipy and Numpy based module for Linear Algebra Routines with blocked structure

Just a basic outline for now. BlockVector __add__ works with a warning. To be seen how to handle that. A verification function to be added.

BlockMatrix is more set up. Will have to setup a matrix-vector product.
